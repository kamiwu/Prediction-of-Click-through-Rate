# Prediction-of-Click-through-Rate
It's the final project of the course _Machine Learning_. 
</br></br>This project involves predicting clicks for on-line advertisements. The dataset contains more than 30 million observations and 23 categorical attributes related to the click-through rate of online ads. We utilized several classifiers (**decision tree, random forest, Naive Bayes, logistic regression, knn, and neural network**) to find the best model. I developed a modeling methodology including **feature engineering, feature selection, and ensemble methods**. I was responsible for the data cleaning, data exploration, feature engineering, data sampling, modeling of decision tree, random forest and naive bayes and ensemble methods.
</br></br>_Project-Code1.R_ is the R code of data cleaning, feature engineering, feature selection, modeling and ensemble methods -- almost all of the modeling process.
</br>_Project-Code2.py_ is the Python code of neural network.
</br>_ProjectDescription.pdf_ has more explanation of the process.
